#### Goals for this Module
- Understanding depth and randomness in a video game

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - How different game balances their depth
  - Good examples of randomness
- **Challenges faced**:
  - How to create a balanced game without increasing complexity
- **Solutions**:
  - Analyze unnecesary rules or make systems part of the game

#### Learnings
- Depth engages, while too much complexity can deter

#### Free Thinking
- How to numerically calculate if a certain game is "balanced"?

#### Next Steps
- Understand how these elements apply to games I will be developing
