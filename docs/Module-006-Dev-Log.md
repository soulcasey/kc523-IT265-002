#### Goals for this Module
- Working on my game design treatment

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Creating a general treatment for my board game project
- **Challenges faced**:
  - How I will create a unique theme of the game that will distinquish it from existing related games
- **Solutions**:
  - Researching how other games set their theme that can be both unique and relatable to the gameplay

#### Learnings
- Understanding various game themes from the ground up with how they corresponds to the range of audience

#### Free Thinking
- How do other game developers create the theme for the game if it is a more of a gameplay-oriented game with low story aspect?

#### Next Steps
- Creating physical prototype for the boardgame
