#### Learnings
- A game doesnâ€™t need fancy graphics or complex gameplay. Simple games that can appeal to many people can still be very successful.

#### Free Thinking
- If simple games like Pac-Man or Flappy Bird can become huge hits, why do companies put so much effort into making big, complex games?

#### Next Steps
- Think of simple but fun features to make a game enjoyable and unique
