#### Goals for this Module
- Understanding the color theory implemented into video games

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Examine how game designers implement colors into their games
  - Explore why certain colors are chosen outside of aesthetic reasons
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Identifies what are simple aesthetic color choices and what are color theory adaptations
- **Solutions**:
  - Compare the game's theme with the color theory wheel

#### Learnings
- Some colors are chose strategically to match the color theory

#### Free Thinking
- How much do these color theory colors actually influence the theme?
- How do designers consider the theme if colors do not match the color theory?

#### Next Steps
- While I'm not an artist myself, I will try to adapt these theory to more deeply understand the game designer's choices and what kind of mood they are aiming to provide
